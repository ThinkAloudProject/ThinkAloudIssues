# ThinkAloudIssues
A repo for all Thinkloud issues.

## Issues
**Please** create good descriptive issues with screenshots or, even better, videos to help us better understand the problem. If you know programming, you even can suggest a way to fix a bug, for example, for us to fix it faster.<br>
If your issue is just a suggestion, please provide reasons why implementing "this" would make ThinkAloud better. Thanks!
